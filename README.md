# 🗂️ Folder Stats Analyzer

A simple yet powerful **C++17 command-line tool** that recursively scans a directory to count:

- 📁 Total number of **folders**
- 📄 Total number of **files**
- 📦 **Total size** of all files (in MB)

This project demonstrates practical use of the **C++ `<filesystem>` library** and serves as a foundation for research in **distributed caching, data management, and performance-aware file systems**.
